```python
import tenseal as ts
import numpy as np

context = ts.context(ts.SCHEME_TYPE.CKKS, poly_modulus_degree=8192, coeff_modulus_bit_sizes=[60, 40, 40])
key_generator = ts.CKKSKeyGenerator(context)
encryptor = ts.CKKSEncryptor(context, key_generator.public_key)
decryptor = ts.CKKSDecryptor(context, key_generator.secret_key)

vector_a = np.random.rand(1024).astype(np.float32)
vector_b = np.random.rand(1024).astype(np.float32)

encrypted_vector_a = encryptor.encrypt(vector_a)
encrypted_vector_b = encryptor.encrypt(vector_b)

convolved_vector = encrypted_vector_a * encrypted_vector_b

decrypted_vector = decryptor.decrypt(convolved_vector)

print(decrypted_vector)
```
Note: This code snippet assumes that you have installed the TenSEAL library and have the necessary dependencies. Also, please note that the CKKS scheme is not suitable for performing convolution directly. Instead, you would need to perform a number of multiplications and additions to emulate the convolution operation. The above code snippet is just an example of how you can perform a multiplication operation between two encrypted vectors using TenSEAL.
